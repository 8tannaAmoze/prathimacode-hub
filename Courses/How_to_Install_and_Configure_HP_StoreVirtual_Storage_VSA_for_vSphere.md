# How to Install and Configure HP StoreVirtual Storage VSA for vSphere
 
If you are looking for a way to create shared storage on a virtualized server, you might be interested in HP StoreVirtual Storage VSA (Virtual Storage Appliance) software. This software is a virtual machine that supports VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisor environments. It allows you to use internal disk storage or any block storage that is on the VMware HCL as a shared storage pool for your virtual machines.

In this article, we will show you how to install and configure HP StoreVirtual Storage VSA for vSphere, which is pre-formatted for use with VMware vSphere. You will need to install VSA on all the ESXi hosts that you want to use as storage nodes. You will also need to download the StoreVirtual OS 12.5 from the HP website and have a computer or virtual machine that runs the Centralized Management Console (CMC) to administer the StoreVirtual Storage network.
 
## Prerequisites
 
Before you start the installation and configuration process, make sure you have the following requirements met:
 
- VMware vSphere 6.0 or later for StoreVirtual OS 12.5
- Virtual disks with up to 64 TB of space per disk located on internal disk storage or any block storage that is on the VMware HCL
- StoreVirtual VSA for vSphere virtual disks configured as independent and persistent to prevent VM snapshots from affecting them
- The VMFS datastores for the StoreVirtual VSA dedicated to StoreVirtual VSA and not shared with any other VMs
- Microsoft NET 3.5 on the installer client
- vCenter servers properly licensed before connecting to them using the HP StoreVirtual VSA for vSphere installer
- VMFS heap size increased to access more than 8 TB of VMDKs in a VM (see [this article](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1003565) for more information)

## Installation Steps
 
To install HP StoreVirtual Storage VSA for vSphere, follow these steps:

1. Start the CMC installer on the computer or virtual machine that you use to administer the StoreVirtual Storage network. You can download the CMC installer from [this website](https://www.hpe.com/psnow/doc/a00090616en_us). The CMC installation requires 63 MB disk space and 64 MB RAM during runtime.
2. Follow the steps in the installation wizard. When the installation completes, HP is added as a separate Program Group and a shortcut icon is added to the Microsoft Windows desktop.
3. To start the CMC, double-click the icon on your desktop, or from the Start menu, select All ProgramsâHP âHP StoreVirtualâHP StoreVirtual Centralized Management Console.
4. Start the StoreVirtual VSA for vSphere installer on the same computer or virtual machine that runs the CMC. You can download the StoreVirtual OS 12.5 from [this website](https://www.hpe.com/psnow/doc/a00090616en_us).
5. Follow the steps in the installation wizard. You will need to provide information such as vCenter server address, credentials, ESXi host names, IP addresses, network configuration, datastore selection, etc.
6. The installer will create a new virtual machine on each ESXi host that you selected and deploy the StoreVirtual OS 12.5 image on it.
7. The installer will also configure the network settings and assign IP addresses to each StoreVirtual VSA.
8. The installer will add each StoreVirtual VSA to the CMC and create a management group and a cluster with them.
9. The installer will format and initialize the virtual disks that you assigned to each StoreVirtual VSA and add them as storage volumes to the cluster.
10. The installer will enable network RAID 10 (mirroring) across all storage volumes in the cluster by default. You can change this setting later in the CMC if you want.
